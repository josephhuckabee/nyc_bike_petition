<main>NYC has roughly ____ bikes. There are ____ bike lanes. But there aren't many designated parking docks for bikers. Our goal is to create laws and infrastructure across all five bourouhs to encourage more new yorkers to ride bikes. Our planet, our economy, and more importantly our mental and phsyical health all benefit from a society that relys less on cars and more on the power of you.</main>
